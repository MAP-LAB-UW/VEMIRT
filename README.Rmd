# VEMIRT:  Variational Expectation Maximization for High-dimensional IRT Models <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="120" alt="" />

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `VEMIRT` is to provide computationally efficient tools for high-dimensional data, large sample sizes, large item banks, and complex designs. The package contains several example datasets and functions for

* Parallel Analysis
* Exploratory and Confirmatory M2PL Analysis
* Exploratory and Confirmatory M3PL Analysis
* Standard error estimates for Confirmatory M2PL Analysis
* Bootstrap sampling and importance sampling correction for M2PL Analysis
* Differential item functioning detection in M2PL Analysis

## Installation

To install this package from source:

1) Windows users may need to install the
   [Rtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and include the checkbox 
   option of installing Rtools to their path for easier command line usage. Mac users will have to download the necessary tools from the [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and its
   related command line tools (found within Xcode's Preference Pane under Downloads/Components); most Linux
   distributions should already have up to date compilers (or if not they can be updated easily). 

2) Install the `devtools` package (if necessary), and install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("MAP-LAB-UW/VEMIRT")
torch::install_torch()
```
