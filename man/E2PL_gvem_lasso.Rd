\usage{
E2PL_gvem_lasso(u, indic, max.iter = 5000, constrain = "C1", non_pen = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{an \eqn{N \times J} \code{matrix} or a \code{data.frame} that
consists of binary responses of \eqn{N} individuals to \eqn{J} items. The
missing values are coded as \code{NA}}

\item{indic}{a \eqn{J \times K} \code{matrix} or a \code{data.frame} that
describes the factor loading structure of \eqn{J} items to \eqn{K} factors. It
consists of binary values where 0 refers to the item is irrelevant with this factor,
1 otherwise. For exploratory factor analysis with lasso penalty, \code{indic} should be
imposed certain constraints on the a \eqn{K \times K} sub-matrix to ensure identifiability.
The remaining parts do not assume any pre-specified zero structure but instead, the
appropriate lasso penalty would recover the true zero structure. Also see \code{constrain}}

\item{max.iter}{the maximum number of iterations for the EM cycle; default is 5000}

\item{constrain}{the constraint setting: \code{"C1"} or \code{"C2"}. To ensure
identifiablity, \code{"C1"} sets a \eqn{K \times K} sub-matrix of \code{indic} to be an
identity matrix.This constraint anchor \eqn{K} factors by designating \eqn{K} items that load solely on each factor respectively.
Note that the \eqn{K \times K} matrix does not have to appear at the top of the \code{indic} matrix.
\code{"C2"} sets the \eqn{K \times K} sub-matrix to be a lower triangular matrix with the diagonal being ones. That is, there
are test items associated with each factor for sure and they may be associated
with other factors as well. Nonzero entries (in the lower triangular part) except for the diagonal entries of the
sub-matrix are penalized during the estimation procedure. For instance, assume \eqn{K=3}, then the \code{"C2"} constraint will
imply the following submatrix: \eqn{C2=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\\end{bmatrix}}. As shown, item 1 is allowed to only
load on the first factor, item 2 will for sure load on the second factor but it may also load on the first factor (hence a penalty is added
on the \eqn{(2,1)} element of \code{"C2"}, i.e., \eqn{C2_{2,1}} ). Item 3 will for sure load on the third factor but it may also load on the
first two factors. However, note that for all remaining items their loading vector will all be \eqn{(1, 1, 1)} hence indistinguishable from the
third anchor item. Therefore, we need to alert the algorithm that this third anchor item will for sure load on the third factor, and
and whether or not it loads on the first two factors depends on the regularization results. Therefore, we need to specify
\code{"non_pen="} to identify the \eqn{K}th anchor item. Although, \code{"C2"} is much weaker than \code{"C1"}, it still ensures empirical identifiability. Default is \code{"C1"}.
During estimation, under both the \code{"C1"} and \code{"C2"} constraints, the population means and variances are constrained to be 0 and 1, respectively.}

\item{non_pen}{the index of an item that is associated with every factor under constraint \code{"C2"}.
For \code{C1}, the input can be \code{NULL}}
