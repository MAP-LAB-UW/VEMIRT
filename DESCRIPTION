Description: VEMIRT is created to assist researchers in conducting high-dimensional exploratory and confirmatory multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) analysis and corresponding differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. The core computation engine of VEMIRT is a family of Gaussian Variational EM algorithms that are considerably more efficient than currently available algorithms in other statistical packages, especially when the number of latent factors exceeds four.
